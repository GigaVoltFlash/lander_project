# Optimized Rocket Lander Project

The goal of this project is to create a small 6-inch rocket that can estimate its current position and orientation in space, and modify the magnitude and direction of the thrust generated by the 2.5" propellers at its aft end to perform a semi-soft landing at a given point. The directional thrust will be used to correct any errors in the tilt of the rocket, to ensure that the rocket lands upright.

## Requirements:
* The rocket must be capable of soft landing on a flat surface when dropped from 20 ft and with an initial pitch disturbance of $\pm 5 \degree$ in the absence of wind. No requirement is made for the rocket in the presence of wind at this time.
* The rocket must be capable of generating thrust equal to or greater than its weight
* The rocket, as it is falling, should be unable to correct itself to an upright position passively. This is to ensure that any ability to make itself upright is done primarily using the active control system.


## Objectives:
* Implement trajectory optimization techniques on real hardware
* Implement a feedback loop control system on real hardware
* Implement state estimation to accurately esimate the orientation and position of the rocket
* Use PCB design to create a clean sensor data acquisition and computing system
* Use standard building techniques and materials such as 3D-printed PLA, plywood and epoxy to create a sturdy PCB
