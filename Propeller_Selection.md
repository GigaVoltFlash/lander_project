# Propeller Selection

- Based on the CAD, it looks like a reasonable choice of propeller would be one with 2-2.5" in diameter. Three of these would fit in a 6" body tube. Need to do thrust measurements to ensure that the thrust generated is sufficient.

- Appropriate DC motor would have 1.5" shaft
