# Propeller Selection

- Based on the CAD, it looks like a reasonable choice of propeller would be one with 2-2.5" in diameter. Three of these would fit in a 6" body tube. Need to do thrust measurements to ensure that the thrust generated is sufficient.
- The more the blades on the propeller, the more energy it consumes but generates more thrust. To create a balance between the two, I'm going to buy 3 blade propellers and also 6 blade propellers. These are all relatively inexpensive and different ones can be tried on the same motor.

- Appropriate DC motor would have 1.5" shaft
