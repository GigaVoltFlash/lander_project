# Autonomous Lander Project

This project is by Anshuk Chigullapalli, as an attempt to put all my experience over the past three years of engineering together and make a super cool landing rocket. This started of as a means to implement some of the trajectory optimization problems that are used by SpaceX in their landing rockets.
It's going to be powered by propellers. Uhhn, that's all I have so far. It's going to be a long one, this should be fun.
